 My name is Luke, and I am a full-stack developer at Makers Academy.
  Once a senior adviser and speechwriter in Parliament,
  I traded politics for programming, to challenge myself in a new career
  and indulge a love of all things tech. If you are interested in hiring me
  please <a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}"> get in touch</a>, or
  checkout my code on <a href="{{site.github_username}}">Github</a>.
